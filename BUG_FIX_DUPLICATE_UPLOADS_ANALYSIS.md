# Bug Fix #12: Duplicate File Uploads & Missing Analysis Features

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Bug ID**: #12  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: Critical (prevents proper project workflow)

---

## Problem Description

### Issue 1: Duplicate Files
When uploading files to a project condition, the files were being added multiple times, creating hundreds of duplicates:
```
Frame8_spots.csv (repeated 40+ times)
MS2_spots_F2C2.csv (repeated 40+ times)
MS2_spots_F1C1.csv (repeated 40+ times)
Cell2_spots.csv (repeated 40+ times)
Cell1_spots.csv (repeated 40+ times)
...
```

### Issue 2: No Analysis Options
After loading files into conditions, there were:
- ‚ùå No way to analyze the data
- ‚ùå No way to compare across conditions
- ‚ùå No way to generate reports
- ‚ùå No way to export combined data

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Duplicate Files

**File**: `app.py`, Line ~1721  
**Problem**: File upload handler runs on every app rerun

```python
# BROKEN CODE:
uploaded = st.file_uploader("Add cell files (CSV)", ...)
if uploaded:
    for uf in uploaded:
        # This runs EVERY time the app reruns
        pmgr.add_file_to_condition(proj, cond.id, uf.name, df)
    st.rerun()  # Triggers another rerun ‚Üí adds files again ‚Üí infinite loop
```

**Why It Failed**:
1. Streamlit file_uploader retains uploaded files in memory
2. Every app rerun re-triggers the `if uploaded:` block
3. Files get added repeatedly without checking if they already exist
4. Can create hundreds of duplicates in seconds

### Issue 2: No Analysis Workflow

**Problem**: Project Management page had no analysis capabilities
- Could upload files ‚úÖ
- Could pool files into datasets ‚úÖ
- **Could NOT analyze data** ‚ùå
- **Could NOT compare conditions** ‚ùå
- **Could NOT generate reports** ‚ùå

## Solutions

### Fix 1: Prevent Duplicate Uploads

Added session state tracking to only process new files:

```python
# FIXED CODE (app.py line 1721-1746):
uploaded = st.file_uploader("Add cell files (CSV)", type=["csv"], 
                            accept_multiple_files=True, key=f"pm_up_{cond.id}")

# Track which files have been processed to avoid duplicates
upload_key = f"pm_upload_processed_{cond.id}"
if upload_key not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state[upload_key] = set()

if uploaded:
    # Check if these are new files (not already processed)
    new_files = []
    for uf in uploaded:
        file_id = f"{uf.name}_{uf.size}"  # Unique identifier
        if file_id not in st.session_state[upload_key]:
            new_files.append((uf, file_id))
    
    # Only process new files
    if new_files:
        for uf, file_id in new_files:
            try:
                import pandas as _pd
                df = _pd.read_csv(uf)
                pmgr.add_file_to_condition(proj, cond.id, uf.name, df)
                st.session_state[upload_key].add(file_id)  # Mark as processed
            except Exception as e:
                st.warning(f"Failed to add {uf.name}: {e}")
        pmgr.save_project(proj, os.path.join(pmgr.projects_dir, f"{proj.id}.json"))
        st.success(f"{len(new_files)} file(s) added.")
        st.rerun()
```

**How It Works**:
1. Creates unique ID for each file: `filename_filesize`
2. Stores processed file IDs in session state
3. Only processes files not in the "processed" set
4. Prevents duplicates across app reruns

### Fix 2: Add Batch Analysis & Comparison

Added comprehensive analysis section after conditions:

```python
# NEW CODE (app.py line 1790+):
st.divider()
st.header("üìä Batch Analysis & Comparison")

if proj.conditions and any(cond.files for cond in proj.conditions):
    # Select conditions to compare
    conditions_to_analyze = []
    for cond in proj.conditions:
        if cond.files:
            if st.checkbox(f"{cond.name} ({len(cond.files)} files)", 
                         value=True, key=f"analyze_cond_{cond.id}"):
                conditions_to_analyze.append(cond)
    
    # Generate comparative report
    if st.button("üìà Generate Comparative Report", type="primary"):
        # Pool data from each condition
        condition_datasets = {}
        for cond in conditions_to_analyze:
            pooled_df = cond.pool_tracks()
            if pooled_df is not None and not pooled_df.empty:
                condition_datasets[cond.name] = pooled_df
        
        # Show summary statistics
        # Display track counts, frame counts, data points
        # Provide option to load into main workspace for detailed analysis
    
    # Export all condition data
    if st.button("üíæ Export All Condition Data"):
        # Combine all conditions with labels
        # Provide CSV download
```

**Features Added**:
- ‚úÖ Select which conditions to analyze
- ‚úÖ Generate comparative summary report
- ‚úÖ View track counts, frame counts, data points per condition
- ‚úÖ Load condition into main workspace for Enhanced Report Generator
- ‚úÖ Export combined CSV with condition labels
- ‚úÖ Download combined data from all conditions

## Files Modified

| File | Lines | Changes |
|------|-------|---------|
| `app.py` | 1721-1746 | Fixed duplicate file uploads |
| `app.py` | 1790-1893 | Added batch analysis section |

**Total**: 1 file, ~120 lines added/modified

## Prevention Strategy

### For File Uploads
1. ‚úÖ **Track processed files**: Use session state
2. ‚úÖ **Unique identifiers**: filename + filesize
3. ‚úÖ **Check before adding**: Only process new files
4. ‚úÖ **Clear feedback**: Show count of files added

### For Batch Operations
1. ‚úÖ **Provide selection UI**: Checkboxes for conditions
2. ‚úÖ **Show summaries**: Statistics before detailed analysis
3. ‚úÖ **Enable drill-down**: Load into main workspace
4. ‚úÖ **Support export**: Combined data with labels

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- **File tracking per session**: Cleared on app restart (intentional)
- **Memory usage**: All condition data loaded for comparison
- **No caching**: Reports regenerated each time

### Future Enhancements
1. **Persistent tracking**: Store in project JSON
2. **Streaming analysis**: Process conditions one at a time
3. **Cached results**: Save analysis results per condition
4. **Parallel processing**: Analyze multiple conditions simultaneously
5. **Advanced comparisons**: Statistical tests between conditions
