# Bug Fix #11: Project File Save Error - Quick Summary

## 🐛 The Problem
When you upload CSV files to a project condition and try to save, you get:
```
RuntimeError: Failed to save project: Object of type bytes is not JSON serializable
```

## ✅ The Fix
**Two changes in `project_management.py`**:

1. **Save files to disk** instead of storing as bytes in memory
2. **Exclude bytes** from JSON serialization

## 🧪 Test Results
```
python test_project_json_fix.py
```
**Result**: 🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!

- ✅ Files saved to CSV on disk
- ✅ Metadata stored in JSON (without bytes)
- ✅ Data can be loaded back from CSV
- ✅ No JSON serialization errors

## 📁 New File Structure
```
spt_projects/
├── project_id.json          # Project metadata (JSON)
└── data/
    ├── file_id_1.csv        # Track data for file 1
    ├── file_id_2.csv        # Track data for file 2
    └── file_id_3.csv        # Track data for file 3
```

## 🎯 What This Means For You

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Uploading files to projects → CRASH
- ❌ Cannot save projects with files
- ❌ Data lost on app restart

### After Fix:
- ✅ Upload files to projects → WORKS
- ✅ Projects save successfully
- ✅ Data persists across restarts
- ✅ Can access CSV files externally

## 🚀 Try It Now

1. Restart your app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Go to **Project Management** tab
3. Create a new project
4. Add a condition
5. Upload CSV files
6. **Should save without error!** ✅

## 📊 Additional Benefits

- **Memory Efficient**: Large files not kept in RAM
- **External Access**: CSV files can be opened in Excel, Python, etc.
- **Better Organization**: Clean separation of metadata and data
