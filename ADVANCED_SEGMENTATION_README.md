# Advanced Segmentation Methods for SPT Analysis

This document describes the implementation of state-of-the-art AI-powered segmentation methods (CellSAM and Cellpose) for particle detection in microscopy images.

## Overview

The SPT Analysis application now includes two cutting-edge segmentation methods that replace placeholder CNN functions with real, pre-trained models:

1. **CellSAM (Cell Segment Anything Model)** - Meta's Segment Anything Model specialized for cellular images
2. **Cellpose** - Deep learning-based segmentation optimized for various cell types

## Features Implemented

### CellSAM Integration
- **Foundation Model**: Uses Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture
- **Cell Specialization**: Optimized for mammalian cells, yeast, and bacteria
- **Human-level Accuracy**: Achieves human-level performance across different microscopy modalities
- **Model Types**: Supports vit_b (fastest), vit_l (balanced), and vit_h (most accurate)
- **Automatic Detection**: Generates precise segmentation masks automatically

### Cellpose Integration
- **Multiple Models**: Supports cyto, nuclei, cyto2, livecell, bact, and plant models
- **Cell Type Optimization**: Specialized models for different cell types and imaging conditions
- **Robust Performance**: Handles various cell shapes and imaging artifacts
- **Diameter Estimation**: Automatic particle size estimation or manual specification

## Implementation Details

### Core Classes

#### CellSAMSegmentation
```python
class CellSAMSegmentation:
    def __init__(self, model_type="vit_b", device="auto")
    def load_model(self, checkpoint_path=None)
    def detect_particles(self, image, confidence_threshold=0.5, size_filter=(10, 1000))
```

#### CellposeSegmentation
```python
class CellposeSegmentation:
    def __init__(self, model_type="cyto", device="auto")
    def load_model(self)
    def detect_particles(self, image, diameter=None, flow_threshold=0.4, cellprob_threshold=0.0, size_filter=(10, 1000))
```

### Enhanced CNN Detection Function

The placeholder `cnn_detect_particles` function has been completely replaced with real implementations:

```python
def cnn_detect_particles(image, model=None, threshold=0.5, method="cellpose", model_type="cyto"):
    """
    CNN-based particle detection using CellSAM or Cellpose segmentation.
    Automatically falls back to blob detection if advanced methods unavailable.
    """
```

## User Interface Integration

### Tracking Page Enhancement
- New "AI Segmentation" tab added to the tracking interface
- Method selection between CellSAM, Cellpose, and comparison modes
- Real-time parameter adjustment and model configuration
- Results visualization and comparison tools

### Available Interfaces
1. **CellSAM Interface**: Model type selection, confidence thresholds, size filtering
2. **Cellpose Interface**: Model selection, diameter estimation, flow parameters
3. **Comparison Interface**: Side-by-side comparison of detection results

## Installation Requirements

## Usage Examples

### Basic Detection with CellSAM
```python
# Initialize segmentation
segmenter = CellSAMSegmentation(model_type="vit_b")
segmenter.load_model()

# Detect particles
detections = segmenter.detect_particles(
    image, 
    confidence_threshold=0.5,
    size_filter=(10, 1000)
)
```

### Basic Detection with Cellpose
```python
# Initialize segmentation
segmenter = CellposeSegmentation(model_type="cyto")
segmenter.load_model()

# Detect particles
detections = segmenter.detect_particles(
    image,
    diameter=None,  # Auto-estimate
    flow_threshold=0.4,
    cellprob_threshold=0.0,
    size_filter=(10, 1000)
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### GPU Acceleration
- Both methods automatically detect and use GPU when available
- CPU fallback ensures compatibility across systems
- Device selection: "auto", "cpu", or "cuda"

### Memory Management
