# Biophysical Property Calculation Audit Report

This document contains the audit of the biophysical property calculations in the SPT Analysis suite. The audit was performed to ensure that the formulas are correctly implemented and that the outputs have appropriate visualization and statistical analyses.

## Audit Findings

I will document my findings for each module below.

### `analysis.py`

#### `calculate_msd`
-   **Formula:** The Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) for a lag time `tau = n*dt` is calculated as the average of the squared displacements for all time intervals of length `tau`. The formula is `MSD(tau) = <|r(t + tau) - r(t)|^2>`.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation iterates through each track, and for each lag, it calculates the squared displacements `(x(i+lag) - x(i))^2 + (y(i+lag) - y(i))^2`. It then takes the mean of these squared displacements. This is a correct implementation of the formula.
-   **Visualization:** This function only calculates the data. The visualization is handled by `plot_msd_curves` in `visualization.py`. This function plots the individual MSD curves for each track and the ensemble average with error bars, which is appropriate.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the MSD for each track and the number of points used for each calculation. The `plot_msd_curves` function calculates the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) for the ensemble average, which is a good statistical practice.
-   **Assessment:** The `calculate_msd` function is correctly implemented.

#### `analyze_diffusion`
-   **Formula:** This function analyzes the MSD curves to extract diffusion properties.
    -   **Diffusion Coefficient (D):** For normal diffusion in 2D, `MSD(t) = 4Dt`. The implementation uses `linregress` to fit a line to the first few points of the MSD curve and calculates `D = slope / 4`. This is a standard and correct approach.
    -   **Anomalous Diffusion Exponent (alpha):** For anomalous diffusion, `MSD(t) ~ t^alpha`. The implementation performs a log-log fit of the MSD curve (`log(MSD) = alpha * log(t) + C`) and extracts `alpha` as the slope. This is also a standard and correct method.
    -   **Confinement Radius:** The implementation estimates the confinement radius from the plateau of the MSD curve using `sqrt(MSD_plateau / 4)`. This is a reasonable approximation for 2D confined diffusion.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly uses `scipy.stats.linregress` for fitting. It also handles different fitting methods (`linear`, `weighted`, `nonlinear`). The logic for categorizing diffusion types based on `alpha` is standard. The confinement check is based on a heuristic (slope decrease), which is a reasonable approach.
-   **Visualization:** The results of this function are visualized by `plot_diffusion_coefficients` and `plot_msd_curves` in `visualization.py`. These plots are appropriate for visualizing the distribution of D and the MSD curves.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of the diffusion coefficient and alpha exponent. It also calculates confidence intervals for the fitted parameters. This is a good statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_diffusion` function is well-implemented and provides a comprehensive analysis of diffusion properties.

### `analyze_motion`

-   **Formula:** This function calculates various motion properties.
    -   **Speed:** Calculated as `sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) / dt`. This is correct.
    -   **Angle Changes:** Calculated using `np.arctan2(vy, vx)`. This is correct.
    -   **Straightness:** Calculated as `net_displacement / total_path_length`. This is the standard definition.
    -   **Velocity Autocorrelation:** The implementation calculates the correlation coefficient between the velocity vector at time `t` and `t+lag`. This is a correct implementation of the VACF.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly calculates displacements, velocities, and angles. The use of a rolling window for local properties is a good approach. The motion classification logic is heuristic-based but reasonable for a first-pass analysis.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `plot_motion_analysis` in `visualization.py`, which shows a pie chart of motion types and a boxplot of diffusion coefficients. This is a good summary. `plot_velocity_correlation_analysis` also provides a dedicated plot for the VACF.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates mean, median, and standard deviation for various motion parameters. It also provides counts and fractions for the different motion types. This is a good level of statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_motion` function is well-implemented and provides a good set of motion analysis metrics.

### `analyze_clustering`

-   **Formula:** This function performs spatial clustering using DBSCAN, OPTICS, or Hierarchical clustering. These are standard clustering algorithms.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation uses `sklearn.cluster` for DBSCAN and OPTICS, and `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for Hierarchical clustering. These are standard and well-tested libraries. The logic for tracking clusters over time is a simple nearest-neighbor approach based on centroid proximity, which is a reasonable heuristic.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `plot_clustering_analysis` in `visualization.py`, which shows a scatter plot of the clusters at a single frame. This is a good way to visualize the clustering results.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates statistics for each cluster (centroid, radius, density) and for each frame (number of clusters, clustered fraction, mean cluster size). It also analyzes cluster dynamics (duration, displacement, size change). This is a comprehensive statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_clustering` function is well-implemented and uses standard libraries correctly.

### `analyze_dwell_time`

-   **Formula:** This function analyzes the time a particle spends in a specific region or in a "dwelling" state (low movement).
-   **Implementation:** The implementation has two modes: region-based and motion-based.
    -   **Region-based:** It checks if a particle is within a given radius of a defined center. This is a correct way to define a region.
    -   **Motion-based:** It detects periods of low movement by thresholding the displacement between consecutive frames. The threshold is adaptively chosen based on the track's median displacement, which is a good approach to handle tracks with different mobilities.
-   **Visualization:** The results are not directly visualized by a dedicated function. The UI in `app.py` displays the results in a table. A visualization of dwell events on the tracks could be a useful addition.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the number of dwell events, total dwell time, mean dwell time, and dwell fraction for each track. It also provides ensemble statistics. This is a good statistical summary.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_dwell_time` function is well-implemented. A dedicated visualization could be an improvement.

### `analyze_gel_structure`

-   **Formula:** This function analyzes the structure of a gel-like environment based on the confinement of particle trajectories. It estimates the mesh size from the confinement radii of the tracks.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation identifies confined regions by looking for windows in a trajectory with a low diffusion coefficient. The mesh size is then estimated as twice the median confinement radius, which is a reasonable heuristic. It also uses DBSCAN to find clusters of pores, which is a good way to analyze the heterogeneity of the gel.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization function for the gel structure analysis. The UI in `app.py` displays the results as text. A visualization of the confined regions and pore clusters on top of the tracks would be very informative.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the mean mesh size and heterogeneity. If pores are clustered, it calculates cluster statistics. This is a good start, but more advanced statistical analysis could be added (e.g., distribution of pore sizes).
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_gel_structure` function provides a reasonable analysis of gel structure. However, it would benefit greatly from dedicated visualizations.

### `analyze_diffusion_population`

-   **Formula:** This function uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify different diffusion populations from the distribution of diffusion coefficients.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation first calculates the diffusion coefficient for each track. It then fits a GMM to the log-transformed diffusion coefficients. Using log-transform is a good practice as diffusion coefficients often follow a log-normal distribution. It uses `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture`. The number of populations can be specified by the user. It also has a mechanism to automatically select the best number of components based on BIC/AIC, which is a robust approach.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized in the `app.py` UI. It shows a table of the population parameters and a histogram of the diffusion coefficients with the fitted GMM components overlaid. This is a good visualization.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the mean, standard deviation, and weight of each population. It also assigns each track to a population. This is a good level of statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_diffusion_population` function is well-implemented and uses a standard and robust method for population analysis.

### `analyze_crowding`

-   **Formula:** This function analyzes the effect of local particle density on particle dynamics. It calculates the local density around each particle and correlates it with the particle's displacement.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation calculates the local density by counting the number of neighbors within a given radius. It then calculates the correlation between local density and displacement for each track. This is a reasonable approach.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `plot_particle_interaction_analysis` in `visualization.py`, which shows a density map and a scatter plot of mobility vs. local density. This is a good way to visualize the results.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between density and displacement for each track. It also provides ensemble statistics like the mean correlation and the fraction of tracks with significant correlation. This is a good statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_crowding` function is well-implemented.

### `analyze_active_transport`

-   **Formula:** This function identifies directed motion by looking for segments of trajectories with high straightness.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation uses a sliding window approach to calculate the straightness of trajectory segments. If the straightness is above a certain threshold, the segment is considered directed. This is a reasonable heuristic for detecting active transport.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `plot_active_transport` in `visualization.py`, which shows a histogram of segment speeds and a polar plot of segment directions. This is a good way to summarize the properties of the directed segments.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates properties for each directed segment (duration, speed, angle, etc.) and provides ensemble statistics (mean speed, mean duration, etc.). This is a good statistical analysis.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_active_transport` function is well-implemented.

### `analyze_boundary_crossing`

-   **Formula:** This function detects when particles cross defined boundaries.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation can handle different types of boundaries (lines, circles). It checks for crossings by looking at consecutive points in a trajectory. It also has a feature to automatically detect boundaries based on density gradients, which is a nice advanced feature.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization function for this analysis. The UI in `app.py` displays the results in a table. A visualization of the tracks and the boundaries, with crossing events highlighted, would be very useful.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the number of crossings for each track and for each boundary. It also calculates residence times in different regions. This is a good statistical summary.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_boundary_crossing` function is well-implemented, but like `analyze_dwell_time`, it would benefit from a dedicated visualization.

### `analyze_polymer_physics`

-   **Formula:** This function analyzes the MSD curve to extract polymer physics parameters. It uses the scaling of the MSD (`MSD ~ t^alpha`) to determine the motion regime (e.g., Rouse, reptation).
-   **Implementation:** The implementation calculates the scaling exponent `alpha` from a log-log fit of the MSD curve. It then uses the value of `alpha` to classify the motion regime. This is a standard approach in polymer physics. It also estimates the tube diameter for the reptation model and the mesh size from the crossover point in the MSD curve. These are reasonable estimations.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `plot_polymer_physics_results` in `visualization.py`, which shows histograms of the persistence length and other parameters. This is a good start, but a plot of the MSD curve with the different regimes highlighted would be more informative.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the scaling exponent and other parameters. The `plot_polymer_physics_results` function shows histograms, which is a form of statistical analysis. More detailed statistics (mean, median, etc.) could be added.
-   **Assessment:** The `analyze_polymer_physics` function provides a good starting point for polymer physics analysis. It could be improved with more detailed statistical analysis and more informative visualizations.

### `advanced_biophysical_metrics.py`

#### `tamsd_eamsd`

-   **Formula:**
    -   Time-Averaged MSD (TAMSD): `(1/(N-n)) * sum_{i=0}^{N-n-1} [r(i*dt + n*dt) - r(i*dt)]^2`
    -   Ensemble-Averaged MSD (EAMSD): `<MSD_i(n*dt)>_i` where `i` is the track index.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly calculates the TAMSD for each track and then the EAMSD by averaging over all tracks.
-   **Visualization:** The results are used in `plot_msd_curves` in `visualization.py`.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function returns the TAMSD for each track and the EAMSD. The `plot_msd_curves` function calculates SEM for the EAMSD.

-   **Formula:**
    -   Ergodicity Breaking (EB) ratio: `<TAMSD> / EAMSD`.
    -   EB parameter: `<(TAMSD / <TAMSD> - 1)^2>`.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly calculates these two ergodicity parameters. It also includes bootstrap resampling to estimate confidence intervals, which is good statistical practice.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization function for ergodicity measures. The results are likely displayed in a table in the UI. A plot of the EB ratio and parameter vs. lag time would be a good addition.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the EB ratio and parameter, and provides confidence intervals via bootstrapping.
-   **Assessment:** The `ergodicity_measures` method is correctly implemented. A dedicated visualization would be an improvement.

-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly calculates the 1D and 2D NGP for different lag times.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization function for the NGP. A plot of NGP vs. lag time would be the standard way to visualize this.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the NGP for each lag. No error estimation is performed.
-   **Assessment:** The `ngp_vs_lag` method is correctly implemented. A dedicated visualization would be an improvement.

### `van_hove`

-   **Formula:** The van Hove correlation function `G(r, t)` gives the probability that a particle has a displacement `r` in a time interval `t`. This implementation calculates the distribution of displacements `dx` and `dr` for a given lag time.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation collects all displacements for a given lag and then calculates the histogram of these displacements. This is a correct way to calculate the van Hove correlation function.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization function for the van Hove correlation. The results are returned as histogram data. A plot of the displacement distribution would be the standard visualization.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function returns the histogram data. No further statistical analysis is performed.
-   **Assessment:** The `van_hove` method is correctly implemented. A dedicated visualization would be an improvement.

### `vacf`

-   **Formula:** The Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF) is calculated as `<v(t) . v(t+tau)> / <v(t) . v(t)>`.

-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function returns a DataFrame of all turning angles. No further statistical analysis is performed.
-   **Assessment:** The `turning_angles` method is correctly implemented. A dedicated visualization would be an improvement.

### `hurst_from_tamsd`

-   **Formula:** This method estimates the Hurst exponent (H) from the scaling of the TAMSD. For fBm, `MSD ~ t^(2H)`. So, `alpha = 2H`, and `H = alpha / 2`.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation calculates the anomalous exponent `alpha` from the log-log slope of the TAMSD curve for each track and then calculates `H = alpha / 2`. This is correct.
-   **Visualization:** The results are not directly visualized by a dedicated function. The Hurst exponent is a single value per track, so a histogram of H values would be an appropriate visualization.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates H for each track. The `compute_all` method calculates the median H.
-   **Assessment:** The `hurst_from_tamsd` method is correctly implemented.

### `fit_fbm_model`

-   **Formula:** This function fits an fBm model to a trajectory. It first estimates the Hurst exponent H using the `fbm.hurst()` function, which is based on the scaling of the increments. Then, it fits the MSD curve to the model `MSD(t) = 4Dt^H` to find the diffusion coefficient D.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly uses the `fbm` library to estimate H. It then calculates the MSD and uses `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to fit for D. This is a robust and correct approach.
-   **Visualization:** There is no dedicated visualization for this function. A plot showing the MSD data and the fitted curve would be a good way to assess the quality of the fit for individual tracks.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function returns H and D for a single track. The `fbm_analysis` method in the `AdvancedMetricsAnalyzer` class calls this for all tracks and the `compute_all` method calculates the median H.

### `rheology.py`

#### `MicrorheologyAnalyzer.calculate_complex_modulus_gser`

-   **Formula:** This function calculates the complex modulus `G*(ω)` using the Generalized Stokes-Einstein Relation (GSER). The formula is `G*(ω) = (kB*T) / (3*π*a*<Δr²(τ)>) * Γ(1+α) * (iω*τ)^α`, where `τ = 1/ω` and `alpha` is the local logarithmic slope of the MSD.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation correctly calculates the local slope `alpha` from the MSD data. It then calculates the prefactor, the gamma factor, and the complex frequency factor. Finally, it calculates `G'` and `G''` from the real and imaginary parts of `G*`. The use of `np.clip` to keep `alpha` in a physical range is a good practice.
-   **Visualization:** The results are visualized by `create_rheology_plots`, which shows `G'` and `G''` vs. frequency. This is the standard way to visualize these results.

-   **Implementation:** The implementation calculates the diffusion coefficient `D` from the slope of the MSD curve (`D = slope / 4`). It then uses this `D` to calculate the viscosity. This is correct for 2D.
-   **Visualization:** The effective viscosity is a single value, so it's displayed as a metric in the UI. This is appropriate.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates a single value for the effective viscosity.
-   **Assessment:** The `calculate_effective_viscosity` method is correctly implemented.

#### `MicrorheologyAnalyzer.calculate_frequency_dependent_viscosity`

-   **Formula:** This function calculates the magnitude of the complex viscosity `|η*(ω)| = |G*(ω)| / ω`.
-   **Implementation:** The implementation first calculates `G'` and `G''` using `calculate_complex_modulus_gser`. It then calculates the magnitude of `G*` and divides by `ω`. This is correct.
-   **Visualization:** The frequency-dependent viscosity is plotted along with `G'` and `G''` in `create_rheology_plots`. This is a good way to visualize the data.
-   **Statistical Analysis:** The function calculates the viscosity for a range of frequencies.

### `biophysical_models.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements advanced biophysical models, including polymer physics, energy landscape mapping, and active transport analysis.
- **Review Summary**: This module contains several classes and functions for sophisticated biophysical analysis. The implemented methods are based on sound physical principles and standard computational techniques.
- **Detailed Findings**:
    - **`PolymerPhysicsModel`**: The `fit_rouse_model` function correctly implements the Rouse model for polymer dynamics (MSD ~ t^0.5), including a log-log fit to determine the anomalous exponent, which is a standard technique. The implementation is correct. Other methods are placeholders.
    - **`EnergyLandscapeMapper`**: This class correctly maps the potential energy landscape from particle positions using the Boltzmann distribution (`U = -kBT * ln(P)`), where probability `P` is estimated from a 2D histogram of positions. The force calculation as the negative gradient of the potential (`F = -∇U`) is also correct. The method for identifying dwell regions and estimating energy barriers is a reasonable and common approximation.
    - **`ActiveTransportAnalyzer`**: This class correctly calculates standard kinematic quantities like velocity, acceleration, and track straightness. The classification of motion into directional segments is based on reasonable heuristics (thresholding speed and straightness).
    - **`analyze_motion_models`**: This function correctly fits track data to three standard models of motion (Brownian, directed, confined) by analyzing the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). It uses appropriate fitting procedures for each model (e.g., linear fit for Brownian, non-linear curve fitting for confined) and selects the best model based on the minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is a valid approach.
- **Conclusion**: The calculations within `biophysical_models.py` are implemented correctly and adhere to established methodologies in the field. The placeholder methods for unimplemented features (`analyze_fractal_dimension`, "drift" and "kramers" energy methods) are noted but do not affect the correctness of the existing code. No corrections are needed.

### 5. `ml_trajectory_classifier.py` & `synthetic_track_generator.py`

- **Purpose**: To classify trajectories using a machine learning model (`ml_trajectory_classifier.py`) trained on physically-based synthetic data (`synthetic_track_generator.py`).
- **Review Summary**: These two modules are reviewed together as the validity of the classifier is entirely dependent on the correctness of the training data.
- **Detailed Findings**:
    - **`synthetic_track_generator.py`**:
        - **Brownian Motion**: Generated by summing displacements drawn from a Gaussian distribution with variance `2 * D * dt`. This is a physically correct simulation of Brownian motion.
        - **Confined Motion**: Implemented as a random walk where the particle's position is clipped to stay within a square boundary. This is a standard and physically reasonable model for confined diffusion.
        - **Directed Motion**: Generated by adding a constant drift vector to the random Brownian displacements. This correctly models a particle undergoing simultaneous diffusion and advection.
    - **`ml_trajectory_classifier.py`**:
        - This module uses a standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture to classify sequences, which is appropriate for trajectory data. The implementation details (padding, one-hot encoding, train/test split) are all standard machine learning practices.
        - The module itself does not contain biophysical formulas but acts as a tool to learn from data.
- **Conclusion**: The synthetic data generator creates tracks based on correct physical models. The machine learning classifier is implemented correctly from a technical standpoint. Therefore, the combination of these modules provides a valid method for trajectory classification, assuming the model is trained on sufficiently representative synthetic data. No corrections are needed.

### 6. `tda_analysis.py`

- **Purpose**: To perform Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on particle positions.
- **Review Summary**: This module uses the `giotto-tda` library to compute persistence diagrams, which characterize the "shape" of the data (e.g., clusters, loops).

### 7. `correlative_analysis.py`

- **Purpose**: To provide a suite of tools for advanced statistical and correlative analysis.
- **Review Summary**: This module correctly implements a wide range of standard statistical techniques to find relationships between different measured parameters.

    - **Correlation Matrix**: Correctly computes a Pearson correlation matrix between multiple track-averaged parameters. The derived parameters (e.g., confinement ratio) are standard.
    - **PCA and Partial Correlation**: Correctly uses standard libraries (`sklearn`, `pingouin`) to perform these advanced statistical analyses.
    - **Colocalization**: Correctly implements a distance-based thresholding algorithm to identify colocalization events between particles in different channels.
- **Conclusion**: All statistical methods in this module are standard and implemented correctly using well-established scientific libraries. No corrections are needed.
