## Known Limitations (Expected Behavior)

1. **TensorFlow Not Installed**
   - LSTM classification not tested
   - Optional dependency - gracefully handled
   - Other ML methods (Random Forest, SVM, K-Means, DBSCAN) fully functional

2. **Streamlit in Test Environment**
   - Report generator requires Streamlit runtime
   - Test validates registration and provides guidance
   - Full integration testing requires: `streamlit run app.py`

3. **PowerShell Execution Policy**
   - venv activation blocked by system policy
   - Workaround: Packages installed to user site-packages
   - Python imports work correctly regardless

   tracks = pd.read_csv('sample data/C2C12_40nm_SC35/Cropped_spots_cell1.csv')
   result = classify_motion_types(tracks, pixel_size=0.1, frame_interval=0.1)
   print(f"Identified {result['n_classes']} motion classes")
   ```

2. **Run Nuclear Diffusion Comparison**
   ```python
   from nuclear_diffusion_simulator import simulate_nuclear_diffusion
   from md_spt_comparison import compare_md_with_spt
   
   # Simulate
   tracks_sim, _ = simulate_nuclear_diffusion(n_particles=50, n_steps=200)
   
   # Compare with experimental
   comparison = compare_md_with_spt(tracks_sim, tracks_exp)
   ```

3. **Generate Enhanced Reports**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   # Navigate to Enhanced Report Generator
   # Select new analyses: ML Classification, MD Comparison, Nuclear Diffusion
   ```

4. **Optional: Install TensorFlow**
