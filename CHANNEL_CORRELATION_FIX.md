# Channel Correlation Analysis Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The channel correlation analysis was not being populated with the right analyses, and data was not being passed to all analysis types properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AnalysisManager (`analysis_manager.py`)

#### Added New Analysis Types
- **Correlative Analysis**: Analyzes intensity-motion coupling and correlations
- **Multi-Channel Analysis**: Analyzes interactions between multiple channels  
- **Channel Correlation**: Calculates correlations between particle channels

#### Updated Available Analyses Dictionary
```python
'correlative': {
    'name': 'Correlative Analysis',
    'description': 'Analyze intensity-motion coupling and correlations',
    'function': self.run_correlative_analysis,
    'requirements': ['position_data', 'intensity_data']
},
'multi_channel': {
    'name': 'Multi-Channel Analysis', 
    'description': 'Analyze interactions between multiple channels',
    'function': self.run_multi_channel_analysis,
    'requirements': ['position_data', 'secondary_channel_data']
},
'channel_correlation': {
    'name': 'Channel Correlation',
    'description': 'Calculate correlations between particle channels',
    'function': self.run_channel_correlation_analysis,
    'requirements': ['position_data', 'secondary_channel_data']
}
```

#### Added New Analysis Methods

##### `run_correlative_analysis()`
- Analyzes intensity-motion coupling using CorrelativeAnalyzer
- Handles multiple intensity columns with intelligent channel detection
- Supports lag correlation analysis
- Includes track statistics correlation when available

##### `run_multi_channel_analysis()`
- Performs colocalization analysis between primary and secondary channels
- Analyzes compartment occupancy for both channels
- Supports distance threshold and frame tolerance parameters
- Integrates with segmentation results when available

##### `run_channel_correlation_analysis()`
- Runs comprehensive analysis on both primary and secondary channels
- Compares dynamics between channels
- Performs intensity correlation analysis
- Supports custom channel naming

#### Enhanced Requirements Checking
- Added `'secondary_channel_data'` requirement type
- Improved intensity data detection to check for multiple column patterns
- Better validation of secondary channel data availability and format

#### Added Module Import Handling
- Added try/except blocks for correlative analysis, multi-channel analysis modules
- Proper availability flags: `CORRELATIVE_ANALYSIS_AVAILABLE`, `MULTI_CHANNEL_ANALYSIS_AVAILABLE`
- Graceful degradation when modules are not available

### 2. Enhanced StateManager (`state_manager.py`)

#### Added Secondary Channel Data Management
- `get_secondary_channel_data()`: Retrieves secondary channel data from session state
- `set_secondary_channel_data()`: Sets secondary channel data with validation
- `has_secondary_channel_data()`: Checks if secondary channel data is available

#### Added Channel Labels Management
- `get_channel_labels()`: Retrieves channel labels for intensity columns
- `set_channel_labels()`: Sets channel labels for better display names

#### Enhanced Data Validation
- Validates required columns (`x`, `y`) in secondary channel data
- Provides clear error messages for missing data
- Handles both `channel2_data` and `secondary_channel_data` keys for compatibility

### 3. Integration Points

#### With Correlative Analysis Module
- Uses `CorrelativeAnalyzer` class for intensity-motion coupling
- Supports intelligent channel detection with fallback to basic patterns
- Handles lag correlation analysis

#### With Multi-Channel Analysis Module  
- Uses `analyze_channel_colocalization()` for particle interaction analysis
- Uses `analyze_compartment_occupancy()` for spatial analysis
- Uses `compare_channel_dynamics()` for comparative analysis

#### With Session State
- Properly accesses secondary channel data from `st.session_state`
- Handles channel labels and custom naming
- Integrates with segmentation results and track statistics

## Key Features

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing modules
- Clear error messages for missing data requirements
- Proper validation of data formats

### Flexible Parameter Support
- Distance thresholds for colocalization analysis
- Frame tolerance for temporal analysis
- Lag ranges for correlation analysis
- Custom channel naming

### Comprehensive Analysis Pipeline
- All three new analysis types can be run individually or as part of a pipeline
- Results are cached for efficiency
- Proper timestamping and metadata

## Usage Examples

### Running Correlative Analysis
```python
analysis_manager = AnalysisManager()
result = analysis_manager.run_correlative_analysis({
    'intensity_columns': ['ch1', 'ch2'],
    'lag_range': 5
})
```

### Running Multi-Channel Analysis
```python
result = analysis_manager.run_multi_channel_analysis({
    'distance_threshold': 2.0,
    'frame_tolerance': 1
})
```

### Running Channel Correlation Analysis
```python
result = analysis_manager.run_channel_correlation_analysis({
    'max_lag': 10,
    'primary_channel_name': 'Primary',
    'secondary_channel_name': 'Secondary'
})
```

### Running Analysis Pipeline
```python
pipeline_result = analysis_manager.execute_analysis_pipeline(
    ['correlative', 'multi_channel', 'channel_correlation'],
    {
        'correlative': {'intensity_columns': ['ch1'], 'lag_range': 3},
        'multi_channel': {'distance_threshold': 1.0},
        'channel_correlation': {'max_lag': 10}
    }
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Data Flow**: Secondary channel data is now properly passed to all analysis types
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: All three types of channel correlation analysis are now available
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear feedback when data or modules are missing
4. **Flexible Integration**: Works with existing UI and can be extended easily
5. **Robust Architecture**: Uses proper state management and modular design

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive error checking and validation. A test script was created to verify:
- Analysis type availability
- Data requirement checking
- Individual analysis execution
- Pipeline execution
- Error handling

This fix ensures that channel correlation analysis is properly populated with all the right analyses and that data flows correctly through the entire analysis pipeline.
